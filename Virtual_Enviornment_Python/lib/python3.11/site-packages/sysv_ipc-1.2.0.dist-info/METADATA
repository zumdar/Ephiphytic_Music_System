# SYSV IPC

`sysv_ipc` is a Python module (written in C) that permits creation and manipulation of System V semaphores, shared memory and message queues. Most (all?) Unixes (including OS X) support System V IPC well. Windows plus WSL or Cygwin might work.

**For complete documentation, see [the usage notes](USAGE.md).**

`sysv_ipc` is compatible with all supported versions of Python 3. Older versions of `sysv_ipc` may [still work under Python 2.x](USAGE.md#support-for-older-pythons).

If you want to build your own copy of `sysv_ipc`, see [the build notes](building.md).
